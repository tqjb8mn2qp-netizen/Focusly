// Data persists across sessions
class DataManager {
  save() { localStorage.setItem('studyBuddyData', JSON.stringify(this.data)); }
  load() { return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('studyBuddyData')); }
}

// Timer actually counts down
class PomodoroTimer {
  start() { 
    this.interval = setInterval(() => {
      this.timeLeft--;
      this.onTick(this.timeLeft);
    }, 1000);
  }
}

// Statistics calculated from real data
getWeeklyStats() {
  return this.dailyLogs
    .filter(log => isThisWeek(log.date))
    .map(log => ({ minutes: log.studyMinutes }));
}
```
